## About

I obtained a double degree in 2014.
I graduated as an Electrical Engineer from [École Polytechnique], France.
and obtained a Master of Science in "System, Control and Robotics" from the [Royal Institute of Technology], Sweden.

In September 2013, I joined the [Gepetto] team at [LAAS-CNRS] for my master thesis project.
From March 2014 to February 2017, I have been a PhD student in the same team, under supervision of [Florent Lamiraux]
From 2017, I have been a post-doc at [LAAS-CNRS], working on manipulation planning.

#### Research
My research is focused on motion planning for object manipulation.
I have worked on the continuity of paths in constrained manifolds.
I proposed an approach to address the manipulation planning problem.

The implementation of my research is integrated in the [Humanoid Path Planner](HPP) library.
The library contains features dedicated to humanoid robots, but is suited for any type of robots.
I have also been working on an - still - unofficial [graphical user interface][hpp-gui].

I mostly interact with [Florent Lamiraux] but have collaborated with
[contributors to the HPP library](https://humanoid-path-planner.github.io/hpp-doc/authors.html),
[Steve Tonneau],
[Nicolas Mansard],
and [Jean-Paul Laumond].
